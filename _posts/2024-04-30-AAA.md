Abridged statement: lazy, and the statement is quite clear ðŸ¤¡

$K=1$ case:  

Let the position of the bridge be $x$.  
If citizen $i$'s office and house are in the same zone, the distance that citizen has to travel is obviously $|S_i-T_i|$.  
Now let us consider the case where citizen $i$'s office and house are in different zones.  
Citizen $i$ would have to travel from their house at $S_i$ to the bridge at $x$, then travel from the bridge at $x$ to their office at $T_i$.  
As such the distance traveled by citizen $i$ will be $|S_i-x|+|T_i-x|+1$ as the width of the river is equal to $1$ too.
