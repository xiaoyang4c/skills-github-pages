Abridged statement: lazy, and the statement is quite clear ðŸ¤¡

$K=1$ case:  

Let the position of the bridge be $x$.  
If citizen $i$'s office and house are in the same zone, the distance that citizen has to travel is obviously $|S_i-T_i|$.  
Now let us consider the case where citizen $j$'s office and house are in different zones.  
Citizen $j$ would have to travel from their house at $S_j$ to the bridge at $x$, then travel from the bridge at $x$ to their office at $T_j$.  
Hence the distance traveled by citizen $i$ will be $|S_j-x|+|T_j-x|+1$ as the width of the river is equal to $1$ too.
As such the total distance traveled by all the citizens will be:  

$$\sum (|S_i-T_i|) + \sum (|S_j-x| + |T_j-x| + 1)$$ 

for each citizen $i$ (whose office and house are in the same zone) and $j$ (whose office and house are in different zones).

Now we just have to figure out how to choose $x$.  
Claim $1$: The optimal $x$ to minimise $\sum (|S_j-x| + |T_j-x| + 1)$ is the median in the set of all $S_j$ and $T_j$.  

Proof $1$: 
We first reduce the problem to:  
Given a sorted array $A$ of $n$ numbers, find a value $x$ such that $\sum |A[i] - x|$ will be minimised.  
Note: we just ignore the $+1$ here and just consider the case for $\sum (|S_j-x| + |T_j-x|)$ as the $1$ could just be added back to final answer regardless of $x$.  
Assume $y$ is the optimal value for $x$ and $y \neq A[\frac{n}{2}] $  
This implies that there will be $>\lfloor\frac{n}{2}\rfloor$ values of $A[i]$ that are either greater than $y$ or smaller than $y$.  
If there are $>\lfloor\frac{n}{2}\rfloor$ that are greater than $y$, incrementing $y$ by $1$ will lead to $\sum |A[i] - x|$ to either decrease, or remain unchanged as the sum will decrease by at most $\lfloor\frac{n}{2}\rfloor$ and increase by at least $\lceil\frac{n}{2}\rceil$.  
Similarly, if there are $>\lfloor\frac{n}{2}\rfloor$ that are smaller than $y$, decrementing $y$ by $1$ will lead to $\sum |A[i] - x|$ decreasing via the same logic.  
We can keep repeating this process until $y$ reaches the median value of $A[\frac{n}{2}]$, which is when there will no longer be $>\lfloor\frac{n}{2}\rfloor$ values of $A[i]$ that are either greater than $y$ or smaller than $y$.  
Thus we can conclude that picking $x$ to be the median value in the array is optimal.  
(This idea is just marginalist principle in economics)

Thus we will just sort the array consisting of all the value of $S_j$ and $T_j$, and set $x$ to the median value in that array.  We can then print 
$\sum (|S_i-T_i|) + \sum (|S_j-x| + |T_j-x| + 1|)$ for the final answer.  



$K=2$ case:
The author as not attempted this part and will likely die doing so. Please wish him all the best. 

Claim $2$: It is optimal that a bridge is built on citizen $j$'s house or office for some $j$  
Proof $2$:  
The idea is the same as our median argument. Placing a bridge from a building that is not a house or an office to the nearest building that is one will lead to the sum of distances traveled by all citizens $j$ to remain the same or decrease. 

Now we want to consider given 2 bridges located at positions $L$ and $R$, which bridge would citizen $j$ choose to cross in order to minimise their travel time.  
Doing some algebra, we get citizen $j$ would choose to travel via the left bridge $L$ iff $|S_j-L|+|T_j-L|<|S_j-R|+|T_j-R|$ and travel via the right bridge $R$ otherwise.  
This looks very similar to the problem we mentioned at the start of proof $2$, but we have to choose between $L$ and $R$ for values of $x$ instead.  
The optimal value $x$ to minimise $|S_j-x|+|T_j-x|$ would be the median of the 2 values $\frac{S_i+T_i}{2}$, and the closer a value $y$ is to $x$ (the smaller the value of $|x-y|$), the smaller the value of $|S_j-y|+|T_j-y|$. This can be proved with the same argument in proof $2$. 

As such we can make a crucial observation:  
Citizen $j$ will choose to use whichever bridge that is closest to $\frac{S_j+T_j}{2}$  
Thus if we sort the citizens by $S_j+T_j$, we realise there will be a prefix of people who will choose bridge $L$ and a suffix who will choose bridge $R$.  
Let $A$ denote the sorted array of citizens who need to cross a bridge, where $A_j = {(S_j,T_j)}$, and size of $A = n$ ($N$ shall denote the total number of citizens instead)
We can iterate through all the possible places $z$ to split the people into a prefix and suffix.  
Citizens in $A[1,...,z]$ shall go through bridge $L$  
Citizens in $A[z+1,...,n]$ shall go through bridge $R$


We then recall our solution for the $K=1$ case and realise that it is optimal to build the 2 bridges in the median positions in the prefix and suffix sections respectively. 
We first consider the case for all possible prefix sections.  
Let the ordered set $P_z$ denote all of the positions of buildings in $A[1,...,z]$.   
$P_z$ will thus be of the size $2z$.  
We know the cost of all citizens in the prefix traveling through $L$ is minimised when the bridge is built at the median position in $P_z, P_z[z]$.  
Since $A_j$ is a pair of values ${(S_j,T_j)}$, the sum of distances in the prefix be:  
$\sum_{j=1}^{z} (|S_j-P_z[z]| + |T_j-P_z[z]|)$ = $\sum_{j=1}^{2z}(|P_z[j]-P_z[z]|)$
Now we just have to manipulate some algebra for magic to happen. 

 $\sum_{j=1}^{2z}(|P_z[j]-P_z[z]|) = \sum_{j=1}^{z}(|P_z[j]-P_z[z]|) + \sum_{j=z+1}^{2z}(|P_z[j]-P_z[z]|)$  

 
 Since $P_z$ is sorted, 
 $P_z[j] < P_z[z]$ for all $j < z$
 and $P_z[j] > P_z[z]$, we can eliminate the $|\.|$ signs:  

 $\sum_{j=1}^{z}(|P_z[j]-P_z[z]|) + \sum_{j=z+1}^{2z}(|P_z[j]-P_z[z]|) = $
 $\sum_{j=1}^{z}(P_z[z]|-P_z[j]) + \sum_{j=z+1}^{2z}(P_z[j]-P_z[z])$
